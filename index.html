        <p>This section will just include my Bio. Grew up in San Diego. Graduated from Olympian High School in 2014. Enlisted in the U.S. Army as an IT specialist for almost 6 years.
          Got out the game in 2020, moved to Salt Lake City to work as an Network Controller(Contractor) at Hill AFB. After about a year there I decided to head south and move to
          Phoenix, AZ. There I worked as an IT engineer for Amazon for about a year before finally moving back home to San Diego to pursue Computer Science.</p>
